# :blue_book: A collection of C# projects and exercises built while working through Pro C# by Andrew Troelsen. 

This repository contains my personal learning journey through the book. 

## :dart: Goal

To understand C# and .NET fundamentals by reading the book and implementing practical examples, mini-projects, and exercises chapter by chapter. This repo serves as a structured learning log and a reference for future projects.

## :file_folder: Structure

All content is organized under the `ProCSharp` folder. Each chapter or major topic from the book is represented as a separate **Visual Studio solution (.sln)**. These solutions contain one or more projects that demonstrate specific concepts, examples, and exercises.
