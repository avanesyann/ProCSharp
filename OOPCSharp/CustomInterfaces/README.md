## Interfaces

An interface is nothing more than a named set of *abstract members*. (abstract methods are pure protcol, they do not provide a default implementation)
Interface types are quite useless on their own, as you cannot allocate interface types as you would a class or structure.
Interfaces do not bring much to the table until they are implemented by a class or structure.
